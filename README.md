## 🧭 Work Philosophy

I believe in technology that **solves real problems**. I'm passionate about AI not just as innovation, but as a practical tool to improve lives—especially where simplicity and efficiency make the biggest difference.

I'm currently exploring how AI agents can become accessible and useful for non-technical users.
